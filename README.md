##### Project Notes

I only added one custom test at the end. It checks to see if url's actually exist for a news feed if the feed is loaded. I was still having trouble with getting my spy event function working correctly. I could get it to pass with the .click event, but as explained in the reviewer comments, just getting the functon to pass doesn't do any good if it's not testing the application correctly and just testing for the sake of testing. Again, my previous reviewers help and comments were very helpful and pointed me to some great references. I especially liked using .each again and exploring that function. I've included comments concerning the "spy" test I've been trying in my submission. Thanks again for the review. They are always a great learning opportunity for me!

I'm excited to use test driven development in creating my web applications!
