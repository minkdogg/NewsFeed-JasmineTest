##### Project Notes

I only added one custom test at the end. It checks to see if url's actually exist for a news feed. I really wanted to use a "spy" but all of my attempts were really only testing jQuery (which doesn't need to be tested). I will be excited to use them in the future.

I'm excited to use test driven development in creating my web applications!
