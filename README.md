##### Udacity-Project 6

Jasmine Feed Reader Test

##### Run Instructions
 
 1) Open index.html in a web-browser (Chrome preferred).

##### Application Notes
 1) Jasmine Test Results will be located at the bottom of the page after the tests have finisehd running.

 2) While testing, the page will load various feeds to run it's test. 

 3) The tests will land the page on linear digressions which is my favorite news feed! If the page is suppossed to
    start on Udacity Blogs I can change that.


##### Project Notes

I only added two custom tests at the end. The first checks to see if url's actually exist for each news feed. The second was my trying to use "spies" and I had a hard time finding a way to use them here so any suggestions on how I could have used them
would be appreciated! I could only think of using them to verify the jQuery event listeners were created. I'm sure there are
better ways to test.

I'm excited to use test driven development in creating my web applications!
